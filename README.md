# Stream Snatch ðŸŽ¬

**Stream Snatch** is a CLI-based YouTube video downloader that allows users to download videos in multiple resolutions, store them locally, and organize metadata. The project is designed with future-proofing in mind, including potential automation for updates and robustness against library changes.

## Features

- Download YouTube videos via command-line input.
- List available resolutions and formats before download.
- Handles both audio and video (progressive formats).
- Checks if `ffmpeg` is installed for best-quality downloads.
- Robust error handling and logging.
- Easy-to-extend for future GUI or SaaS versions.
- Designed for CI/CD pipelines and automated testing.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)
- Optional: [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) for merged audio-video formats

### Installation
